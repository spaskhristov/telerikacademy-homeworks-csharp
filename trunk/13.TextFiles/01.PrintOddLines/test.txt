1.Write a program that reads a text file and prints on the console its odd lines.
2.Write a program that concatenates two text files into another text file.
3.Write a program that reads a text file and inserts line numbers in front 
of each of its lines. The result should be written to another text file.
4.Write a program that compares two text files line by line and prints the 
number of lines that are the same and the number of lines that are different.
 Assume the files have equal number of lines.
5.Write a program that reads a text file containing a list of strings,
 sorts them and saves them to another text file. Example:

 
6.Write a program that replaces all occurrences of the substring "start" with 
the substring "finish" in a text file. Ensure it will work with large files (e.g. 100 MB).
7.Modify the solution of the previous problem to replace only whole words (not substrings).
