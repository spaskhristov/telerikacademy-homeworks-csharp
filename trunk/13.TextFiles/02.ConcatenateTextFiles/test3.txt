1.Write a program that reads a text file and prints on the console its odd lines.
2.Write a program that concatenates two text files into another text file.
3.Write a program that reads a text file and inserts line numbers in front 
of each of its lines. The result should be written to another text file.
4.Write a program that compares two text files line by line and prints the 
number of lines that are the same and the number of lines that are different.
 Assume the files have equal number of lines.
5.Write a program that reads a text file containing a list of strings,
 sorts them and saves them to another text file. Example:

 
6.Write a program that replaces all occurrences of the substring "start" with 
the substring "finish" in a text file. Ensure it will work with large files (e.g. 100 MB).
7.Modify the solution of the previous problem to replace only whole words (not substrings).
Streams are the main I/O mechanisms
The StreamReader class and ReadLine() method are used t
o read text files
The StreamWriter class and WriteLine() method are used to write text files
Always put file handling in using(â€¦) block
Exceptions are unusual events or error 
Write a program that removes from a text file all words listed
 in given another text file. Handle all possible exceptions in your methods.
Write a program that reads a list of words from a file words.txt and finds how
 many times each of the words is contained in another file test.txt. The result
 should be written in the file result.txt and the words should be sorted by the
 number of their occurrences in descending order. Handle all possible exceptions
 in your methods.
