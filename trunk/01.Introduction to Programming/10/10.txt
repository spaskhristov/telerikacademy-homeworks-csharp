10. Provide a short list with information about the most popular programming 
languages. How do they differ from C#?

Answer:
C# is one of the newest programming languages. 
Microsoft says that C# brings the power of C++ with the ease of Visual Basic.
 C# might not be as easy as Visual Basic 6, but it is as easy as Visual Basic .NET 
 (version 7), which was rewritten from the ground up. The end result is that Visual 
 Basic is really no easier than programming C#. In fact, you can actually write many 
 programs with less code using C#.
C# was meant to be an advance over both C++ and Java as a general purpose programming 
language. Although it can be argued that some of its features are a step backward, C# 
clearly includes some constructs that move it beyond its predecessors. 
Although C# removes some of the features of C++ that cause programmers a lot of grief,
 no power or functionality was really lost. Some of the programming errors that are 
 easy to create in C++ can be totally avoided in C#. 
Java, like C++ and C#, is based on C. A lot of what you learn about C# can be applied.
